# Tactical Flag Deck 

This project is aiming to be a multiplayer, card-based strategy game. Right now, the game design is still in the early stages—it’s not super fun yet! I’m developing the game in Unity, using free assets found online for models and animations. The game currently has a multiplayer component that works on a local network with the help of **com.unity.transport** for network operations. 
Although the present version runs on PC, my goal is to make it playable through the web.

## To Do

- [ ] Extract the server module from the main build and deploy it to a public hosting environment
- [ ] Add a game lobby system for multiplayer sessions  
- [ ] Add AI system for single-player mode
- [ ] Implement web-based deployment
- [ ] Improve game design and increase card variety
- [ ] Update models and animations
- [ ] Improve game UI

## How to Play and Test

For now, you can test the multiplayer functionality by building the project through Unity and running it as a standalone application. Additionally, you can play and test the multiplayer features directly from the Unity Editor at the same time.
